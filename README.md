learning obsidian, trying to code c# for uni.

fun fact: i'm still 17y (11m) old.

```csharp
class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("hello world;");
    }
}
```

output:
![hello-world-pixel-3840x2160-15168](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d494058-9f74-4386-99c3-f0895588fc76)
